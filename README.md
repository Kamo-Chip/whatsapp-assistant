# Chrome Extension: Automate Text Conversations Using AI
This Chrome extension allows you to automate your text conversations with the help of AI, reducing the mental load of coming up with responses. Using the OpenAI API, the extension generates suggested responses based on recent messages in your chat. With just a shortcut, you can pick from three options and send a reply quickly and effortlessly.

## Features
- Extracts the last 10 messages from your chat for context
- Uses OpenAI's API to generate three relevant response suggestions
- Simple, user-friendly interface for selecting responses
